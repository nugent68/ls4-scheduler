ls4-scheduler
D Rabinowitz 2025 Jul 16

This is repository containts the source for "scheduler", a
program to read a nightly pre-planned sequence of observations
(a script) for the LS4 survey efficiently execute them. Based on
the field locations, exposure times, number of required exposures,
and other constraints (such as weather interruptions) it implements 
a strategy to execute the observations in the most efficient order. 
THe program communicates with the telescope (tcp) and camera 
(ls4_control) controllers using TCP sockets to coordinate the
observations.

Also included in the repository are scripts for starting/stopping
or  pausing/resuming the scheduler and for checking the telescope
status and making nightly observatopms summaries.

Installation:

  Create a "observer" user to run the LS4 observing progam.

  Copy  ./observer_conf/observer_tcshrc to /home/observer/.tcshrc

  Edit observer_conf/observer_setup.csh and set "LS4_SRC" to the directory
  where this repository (and other LS4 repositories) are located.

  Copy observer_conf/observer_setup.csh to  /home/observer.

  Log in as observer, change to "/home/observer" and execute "observer_setup.csh"


THis is a modification of the scheduler for LSQ (lsq-scheduler)
